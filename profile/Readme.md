## Vision

“We’re not here to join a category. We’re building one.”

EaseMyHood is revolutionizing the future of commerce in India — bringing AI-powered infrastructure to the chaos of offline retail and unstructured social selling. From 500K+ local stores to creators selling through reels, we make the shopping experience seamless, social, and smart.

## What We Solve

### Local Retailers

- Lack of scalable digital storefronts
- High RTO and operational costs
- No data-driven insights or delivery infrastructure

### Social Sellers

- Manual DMs and payments with no trust layer
- No return policies or customer support
- Reliance on algorithms and unstructured tools

Both are stuck — one too offline, the other too unstructured.
